This is achieved by surrounding objects in brackets separated by commas, or calling the `tuple()` function. There is no limit to the amount of objects which can be stored in these sequences other than memory limits of your computer. It is common to see tuples used to group related objects together,such as in a set of coordinates (x, y) or to return multiple objects from a function.\n"
