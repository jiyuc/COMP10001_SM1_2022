    "### 1. What are some of the (numeric) bases we can store numbers with? How can we convert between bases in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, we usually use **decimal numbers** (base 10). This means counting using ten different digits. Other bases which we can store numbers with include base 2 (**binary numbers**, two digits); base 8 (**octal numbers**, eight digits); and base 16 (**hexadecimal numbers**, sixteen digits). We can convert to binary, octal and hexadecimal by using the `bin()`, `oct()` and `hex()` functions respectively. Converting to a decimal number can be done using the `int(num, base)` function, where num is a string containing the number to be converted to decimal and base is the base to be converted from. Writing binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers as numerical literals can be achieved by putting 0b, 0o and 0x respectively before the number (and then they can be entered directly into the `int()` function without specifying a base.)"

    "### 2. Why are binary and hexadecimal convenient for computers? Why is decimal more difficult?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary numbers are good for computers because they store data in a binary format and **processors handle binary values to make calculations**. That‚Äôs why computer storage is measured in ‚Äú**bits**‚Äù or ‚Äú**bytes**‚Äù. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So binary is a computer‚Äôs ‚Äúnative‚Äù type like decimal is ours. Hexadecimal is good since **one hex character can be stored with exactly four bits** (00002 = 016,00012 = 116...11102 = E16,11112 = F16). Decimal is more difficult because to use decimal values, computers must convert them to and from a binary representation and sometimes that conversion isn‚Äôt exact, resulting in numbers which contain rounding errors or other inconsistencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "To represent Unicode characters in text, we have to choose a ‚Äútext encoding‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most basic such encoding, storing each character in a ‚Äúcode unit‚Äù which is seven bits long. This allows only 128 characters to be represented, but that is more than enough for the English language. One code unit also fits nicely into a single byte.\n",
    "In ASCII, characters are usually stored using a whole byte which leaves one redundant bit (each code unit is composed of seven information bits). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ISO-8859** encoding adds an extra 128 characters to ASCII by allowing the use of an eighth bit to store information too. The code unit is eight bits long.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UTF-32** (Unicode Transformation Format 32-bit) is another constant-width encoding, where each character is stored in a code unit of 32-bits (4 bytes). This allows many more characters to be stored, but has the downside of requiring a lot of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**UTF-8** and **UTF-16** are ‚Äúvariable-width‚Äù encodings. UTF-8 stores each character in a code unit of between one and four bytes of information, depending on how much space is needed for it. UTF-16 uses one or two 16-bit code units per code point."
